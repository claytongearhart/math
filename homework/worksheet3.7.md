Applications of Quadratics

Problem 1: The height of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown is modelled by the function $h(t) = 2 + 20t - 4.9t^2$, where $h$ is the height of the ball in meters.<br>
a. Find the height of the ball 3 seconds after it is thrown. <br>
    $h(3) = 2 + 60 - 4.9 \cdot 9 = 17.9$ m.<br>
b. Find the times at which the ball is above a height of 6 meters. <br>
     $h(t) = 6$ <br> $-4 + 20t - 4.9t^2 = 0$ <br> $\frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 - 4(-4)(-4.9)}}{-9.8} = 0.210896998248, 3.87073565481$ <br>
c. Find the maximum height of the ball and when it occurs. <br>
    $t = \frac{-20}{-9.8} = \frac{100}{49}$ <br> $h(\frac{100}{49}) = \frac{1098}{49}$ m<br>

Problem 2: A bus transports people from an airport to a city center. It transports 800 people a day at a cost 5.50 per person. Research has shown that for every decrease of 0.05 in fare, 10 more people will ride the bus. Suppose there have been $x$ decreases of 0.005 below the inital cost of the 5.50.
a. Find an expression, in terms of $x$, for the bus fare. <br> $f_{are}(x) = 5.50 - 0.05x$ <br>
b. Find an expression, in terms of $x$, for the number of people who ride the bus in a day. <br> $c_{ount}(x) = 800 + 10x$ <br>
c. Find an expression, in terms of $x$, for the daily revenue generated by people riding the bus. <br> $r = f_{are} \cdot c_{ount} = -0.5x^2 + 15x + 4400$ <br>
d. Find the number of fare decreases that result in a revenue of 4500. <br> $r(n) = 4500$ <br> $-0.5x^2 + 15x - 100 = 0$ <br> 10 or 20 <br>
e. Find an appropriate domain for this context. <br> $0 \leqslant x < + \infty$ or $0 \leqslant x \leqslant 110$ , depending if loosing money is acceptable. <br>
f. Determine the fare that will yield the maximum number of passengers. <br> either $0$\$ or $-\infty$\$ <br>

Problem 3: A rectangle has length $x$ m and a perimeter of 310 m. <br>
a. Find the function for the area of the rectangle in term of $x$. <br> $a(x) = x(310-x)$ <br> $x(310-x) = -x^2 + 310x$ <br>
b. Use the function to find the dimensions of the rectangle with the maximum possible area. <br> $\frac{310}{2} = 155$ <br> 155m x 155m <br>

Problem 4: Determine if it is possible to bend a 12cm length of wire to form the perpendicular sides of a right-angled triangle with area 20 cm^2. <br>
$b\cdot h 10$ <br> $b + h = 12$ <br> $-b^2 + 12b = 10$ <br> $144 - 0 > 0$ <br> No, it is not possible <br>

Problem 5: Two integers differ by 12 and the sum of their squares is 74. Find the integers. <br> $abs(n-s) = 12$ <br> $n^2 + s^2 = 74$ <br> {5, -7}, {-7,5} <br>

---
Problem 6: A gardener has 40m of fencing to enclose a rectangular garden plot, where one side is an existing brick wall. Find the dimensions of the garden of maximum area. <br>
$s_1 + 2s_2 = 40$ <br> $s_1 \cdot (40-2s_2) = -2x^2 + 40x$ <br> $ \frac{-40}{-4) = 10$ <br> 10m x 20m <br>

Problem 7: An open-square based container is made by cutting 4cm square pieces out of a piece of tinplate. If the volume of the container is 120 cm^3, find the size of the original piece of tinplate. <br>


---
Problem 8: For what value(s) of $k$ would the graph of $y=x^2 - 2x + k$ never touch or cross the $x$ - axis? <br>
$4 - 4k < 0$ <br> $k < 1$
